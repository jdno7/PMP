            mechanical engineer, and electrician.`,

        'Smoothing':
            `This approach smooths out the conflict by 
            minimizing the perceived size of the problem. It

            `The project team struggles for project positions, 
            leadership, and project direction. The project 
            team can become hostile toward the project 
            leader, challenge ideas, and try to establish and

            specialties that the project will require to

        'Lessons learned':
            `This is documentation of what did and did not 
            work in the project implementation. Lessons 
            learned documentation is created throughout 
            the project by the entire project team. When 
            lessons learned sessions are completed, they’re 
            available to be used and applied by the entire

            sender to the receiver without any real

            received or understood. Consider letters, faxes, 
            voicemail messages, e-mails, and other

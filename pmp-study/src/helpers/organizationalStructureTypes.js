        `Employees groups are flexible, people work side by 
        side on project work. The project manager has little to no authority and is 
        like a part-time role. Project managers might be called a project 
        coordinator. The project budget is managed by the organization’s owner or 
        operator.`,

    'Functional':
        `A functional structure isolates every department and project 
        by function, such as Sales, Marketing, Finance, IT, and Manufacturing. 
        Every department sponsors its own projects, and departments may have to 
        “buy” services from one another using internal dollars and cost centers. The 
        functional managers have all of the project power, and project managers 
        may actually be called project coordinators or expeditors. The project 
        budget is managed by the functional manager`,

    'Multi-divisional':
        `De-centralized structure, which means replication of 
        functions within each division (such as each division would have its own IT 
        department or IT group). The project manager likely has little to no authority 
        and is a part-time role. The functional manager manages the project 
        budget.`,

    'Weak matrix':
        `In a weak matrix, the project manager has little authority or 
        project power to make decisions. The functional managers have more 
        authority than the project manager. The functional manager controls the 
        project budget.`,
        
    'Balanced matrix':
        `The project manager and the functional managers 
        share project authority, though there’s often a power struggle over project 
        decisions. The functional manager and the project manager have shared 
        ownership of the project budget.`,
        
    'Strong matrix':
        `The project manager has more authority over project 
        decisions than the functional managers. The project manager is a full-time 
        role and the project manager manages the project budget.`,
        
    'Project-oriented':
        `This structure assigns all of the authority to the project 
        manager, and the project team is on the project full-time. The project team 
        does not serve on other projects, as in a matrix, and they’ll work on the 
        project until the project is closed. The project manager manages the project 
        budget.`,

    'Virtual':
        `The organization is a network structure with points of contact for 
        each group within the organization. The project manager can be full-time or 
        part-time, and the project manager and the functional manager share 
        management of the project budget.`,
        
    'Hybrid':
        `This structure is a hybrid of different attributes of these defined 
        organizational structures. An organization can design its own structure and 
        power assignment based on its needs. A composite structure doesn’t 
        necessarily assign more power to the project manager, as it’s created by 
        the organization based on the needs within the organization.`,

    'PMO':
        `PMO usually means project management office, but could mean 
        portfolio or program management office. The project manager has high to 
        total power over the project, is a full-time role, and manages the project 
        budget.`,
